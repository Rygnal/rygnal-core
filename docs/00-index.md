# Rygnal Documentation Index

Rygnal is a runtime security and governance control layer for AI-agent tool actions.

This index separates docs by purpose so contributors can quickly find current product truth versus engineering design notes and historical material.

## Canonical Product Docs

These are user-facing and actively maintained.

- README.md
- getting-started.md
- architecture.md
- security-model.md
- known-limitations.md
- v0.1-scope.md
- release-readiness-v0.1.md
- release-notes-v0.1-draft.md
- tool-side-effects.md
- 38-v02-roadmap.md

## Internal Engineering and Design Docs

## Historical and Archive Docs

These are kept for context/history and should not be treated as current direction.

- 01-research-before-building.md
- 02-tools-and-tech-stack.md
- 03-production-architecture.md
- 04-low-cost-production-plan.md
- 05-mvp-demo-plan.md

- archive-early-planning.md

## Test-Locked Documentation

Many docs are validated by tests in `tests/test_*docs.py`. If a file is removed or renamed, update the related tests in the same change.
