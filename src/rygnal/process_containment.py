"""Process-tree containment modeling and enforcement for guarded execution.

This module defines the strict security boundaries for process execution.
POSIX process groups, sessions, and `killpg()` are NOT security boundaries;
they are easily bypassed via `setsid()`, double-forking, or backgrounding.

True guarded execution requires atomic tree-kill capabilities, primarily
provided by Linux PID namespaces (e.g., Bubblewrap) or `cgroups`. Backends
lacking these primitives must explicitly report leaky containment boundaries.
